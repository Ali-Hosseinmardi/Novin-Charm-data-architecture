# Novin Charm – Data Strategy & Architecture

This project presents a real-world case study and proposal to modernize the data infrastructure of Novin Charm, a leading leather goods company in Iran. It is based on my real-world experience at Novin Charm, where I began in a sales role and progressively expanded into data analysis and reporting, and academic work during my MBA at The Hague University.
